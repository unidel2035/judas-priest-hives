🎯 Core Functionality

The primary endpoint (POST /api/v1/chat/completions) allows you to interact with various language models. It's designed as an API aggregator, giving you access to multiple AI providers through a single, unified interface.
💡 Key Features

The API supports several advanced features essential for modern AI applications:

    🤖 Provider Aggregation: Automatically selects the best provider for the model you request.

    🛠️ Tool Calling: Models can call external functions you define.

    🎨 Multimodal Input: Supports prompts containing both text and images.

    ⚡ Streaming: Delivers responses in real-time using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

    🧠 Reasoning Tokens: Works with models that can show their internal reasoning process.

    💰 Ruble Billing & Detailed Accounting: Costs are calculated in rubles, with detailed token usage and cost breakdowns in responses.

📝 Main Request Parameters

To get a response, you need to structure your request with these core parameters:
Parameter	Description
model	(Required) The ID of the model you want to use (e.g., openai/gpt-4o).
messages	(Recommended) An array of message objects that form the conversation history.
max_tokens	The maximum number of tokens the model can generate in its response.
temperature	Controls randomness (0 = deterministic, 2 = very creative).
tools	An array of function definitions that the model can call.
stream	A boolean to enable streaming mode for the response.
🔑 Authentication

All requests must include your API key in the header:
http

Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

💬 Structuring a Conversation

Conversations are built using messages with specific roles in the messages array:

    user: For messages from the end-user.

    assistant: For previous responses from the AI.

    system: To set initial instructions and context for the AI's behavior.

    tool: To send back the results of a function call.

🔌 OpenAI SDK Compatibility

A significant advantage is its compatibility with the standard OpenAI SDK. You can integrate it easily by just changing the base_url:
python

from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.polza.ai/api/v1",  # Change this line
    api_key="YOUR_POLZA_API_KEY"  # Use your Polza key
)
